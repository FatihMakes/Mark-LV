dashboard/server.py — JARVIS Local HTTP Dashboard

HTTPS on port 8000 with a self-signed certificate generated on first run, plus
a second layer inside it: commands are encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a key
derived from the pairing code with PBKDF2. Both layers are required — the
server refuses to start without TLS rather than quietly serving in clear.

#     forty bits — fine against someone guessing at the login endpoint, which
#     is rate limited below, and NOT fine against someone who captured one
#     encrypted command and can guess offline as fast as their GPU allows.
#
#     At one round of SHA-256 that offline search is seconds. PBKDF2 at 200k
#     rounds makes each guess about five orders of magnitude more expensive
#     while costing this server ~80 ms once per session, at pairing time, where

        CBC has no authentication. It hides a message and does nothing to stop
        one being CHANGED: an attacker on the same network can flip bits in the
        ciphertext and the server decrypts whatever falls out, with no way to
        tell. For a channel whose whole purpose is carrying commands to an
        assistant that opens applications and sends messages, "the text was
        secret" is the smaller half of what matters — "the text is the one that
        was sent" is the other half, and CBC never provided it.

        GCM authenticates as it decrypts. A single altered byte raises
        InvalidTag and the request is refused rather than obeyed.

    The old CBC path is not kept as a fallback on purpose. An attacker who can
    choose which format the server accepts can simply choose the weak one, and
    a downgrade left available is a downgrade that will be used.

        WHY THE DEFAULT IS PLAIN HTTP, AFTER A RELEASE THAT MADE TLS MANDATORY
            The certificate has to be self-signed — there is no certificate
            authority on earth that will vouch for 192.168.1.108 — and a phone
            treats a self-signed certificate as an attack. Chrome shows a
            full-page interstitial; a QR scanner that opens links in its own
            in-app browser often shows nothing at all and offers no way to
            proceed, because those views deliberately have no "Advanced" button.

            So the practical result of requiring TLS was a dashboard nobody
            could reach, which is not a more secure product than one they can.
            The pairing key, the rate limit, the token expiry and the
            revoke-all-devices fix are all unaffected and all still apply.

            What IS lost over plain HTTP is the AES-GCM layer, because
            `crypto.subtle` does not exist outside a secure context. The page
            says so on its own badge rather than pretending, and commands then
            travel the local network in clear — which is what this dashboard
            did for every release before this one.

            Turn it on with "dashboard_https": true in config/api_keys.json if
            the network is one where that matters; the certificate is generated
            automatically and you will have to accept it once per device.

        THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, WHICH LOOKED LIKE THE SERVER BEING DOWN
            Type `192.168.1.108:8000` into a phone browser and it tries HTTP.
            The TLS server accepts the connection, finds no handshake and
            closes it — which Chrome reports as "This site can't be reached,
            192.168.1.108 refused to connect". The server is running perfectly
            and the user is told it is off.

            The port that used to sit here was a SECOND HTTPS server, added on
            the belief that browsers upgrade a bare `ip:port` to https. Some
            do. Android Chrome does not, so the second port had exactly the
            same failure as the first.

        So this speaks HTTP, and answers everything with a redirect to the same
        path on the HTTPS port. Typing the address by hand now works, which is
        what people do when a QR code is inconvenient.
